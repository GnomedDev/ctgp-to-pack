# CTGP to Track Pack
This python script will decrypt, mount, and extract tracks from the CTGP `in/blob.bin`
and produce `out/tracks`, `out/thumbnails`, and `out/manifest.ini` to be used in MKW-SP

## Warning!
This is currently under heavy development and at time of publishing
there is not support for loading these files in upstream MKW-SP.
